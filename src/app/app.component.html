          Note that we cannot use two structural directives on the same element. So, for the <li> below, we cannot use
          *ngFor to iterate through the numbers and then use *ngIf to check for an odd number. It is possible to use
          pipes to filter an array.

          A solution, demonstrated here, is to wrap the <li> elements inside of a <div> where the <div> holds the *ngIf.
          This requires us to create two arrays in the .ts file.

            Recall, the square brackets around ngClass indicate we are binding to a property of the ngClass directive
            (which also happens to be named ngClass). Similarly, the ngStyle directive has a property with the name
            ngStyle that we bind to.

            The modulus checks in ngClass and ngStyle are redundant here, since we know we are dealing with odd numbers.
            They are included for illustrative purposes.
